## 🔥 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of St. Louis Cardinals pitching data throughout franchise history. From Bob Gibson's dominance in the 1960s to the current generation of Cardinals arms, this project examines the statistical trends, standout performers, and evolutionary patterns that have defined one of baseball's most storied pitching traditions.

## 📊 What's Inside

This Jupyter notebook-driven analysis includes:

- **Reliever ERA Evolution** - See how the bullpen performance has transformed decade by decade from the 1960s through the 2020s
- **All-Time Greats** - Statistical breakdown of the top 20 Cardinals pitching leaders across key metrics
- **WHIP vs. Age Analysis** - Visualization exploring the relationship between pitcher age and WHIP (Walks + Hits per Inning Pitched)
- **Win Prediction Model** - Simple linear regression model predicting starting pitcher seasonal wins based on ERA
- **Bob Gibson Career Deep Dive** - Detailed analysis of the Cardinals' greatest pitcher, showing the relationship between his wins, strikeouts, and ERA throughout his legendary career

## 🚀 Key Insights

- Discover which decade produced the most dominant Cardinals relievers
- Explore how pitching effectiveness correlates with age
- See the statistical evidence behind Bob Gibson's reputation as one of baseball's all-time greats
- Understand the predictive relationship between ERA and wins for Cardinals starters

## 💻 Usage

To explore this analysis:

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
3. Open the main notebook file
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis or modify parameters to explore further

## 📈 Example Visualization

The notebook includes visualizations like the relationship between WHIP and pitcher age, showing how control and effectiveness typically evolve throughout a pitcher's career.

## 🧪 Predictive Model

Our simple linear regression model demonstrates how ERA serves as a predictor for seasonal wins. While not capturing all variables that contribute to a pitcher's win total, this baseline model provides insight into the relationship between preventing runs and securing victories.

## 🏆 Cardinals Pitching Legacy

From the dead-ball era through the modern game, Cardinals pitching has been a cornerstone of the franchise's 11 World Series championships. This analysis provides statistical context to the evolution of pitching in St. Louis and highlights the exceptional performances that have defined Cardinals history.

## 📚 Future Work

Potential extensions to this analysis include:
- Pitch type analysis for modern Cardinals pitchers
- Park effect adjustments across different Cardinals home stadiums
- Comparisons to league averages by era
- More advanced predictive modeling incorporating additional variables
